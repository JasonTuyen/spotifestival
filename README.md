## Getting Started / Instructions
Disclaimer: This repo is just an example with key files. Cloning this project will not get you a working app, but these instructions should lead you in the right direction.
1. [Create an app on Spotify's Developers Website.](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
2. Install necessary dependencies for your project, I used a React frontend and Java backend so I installed [Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) respectively.
3. Detailed dependency information is located in the "package.json" and "pom.xml" files.
4. The Frontend and Backend folders contain key files alongside helpful comments.
